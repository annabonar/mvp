		<g>Purpose</g><br>
		<n>UTMFoodies is a food critique/review website created by students, for students! Our purpose is to provide UTM students an avenue to express their opinions on the restaurants on campus. Students will be able to learn about each restaurant, discover new food items, and hopefully get the best value for their money!</n>
